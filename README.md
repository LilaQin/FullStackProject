# FullStackProject

<p>I am taking courses of Full stack Web Development Specialization on Coursera. I plan to upload all the interesting projects I finished during this course.</p>
<p> The first project is an interactive matching game that I finished in the first course *HTML, CSS and JavaScript*. </p>
<p> When the game starts, five faces are shown on the left and four are shown on the right. The left and right sides are identical, except for one thing: the left side has one extra face. The user needs to click on that extra face. If anything except the correct face is clicked, a message is displaced saying that the game is over. If the correct face is clicked, all the currently displayed faces are deleted and a new set of faces is shown at random positions. Each time a new set of faces is shown there will be 5 more faces than before, on both the left and right sides. There will always be one extra face shown on the left.</p>
